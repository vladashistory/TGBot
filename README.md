# Crypto TG Bot
 This Python bot acts as a mediator between product sellers and buyers on Telegram. It securely holds cryptocurrency in a wallet (stored in a database) and releases payment to the seller upon mutual approval from both parties.

## Features

- **Escrow Service:** Users can start escrow service and the bot will generate a wallet to receive funds for the transaction. The funds are held until both parties confirm they are satisfied with the exchange. No manual intervention is required to release or hold the funds.

- **Shop Setup:** Sellers can set up shop items with either automatic or manual key/product delivery system. Funds are automatically released to the seller upon successful delivery.

- **Broker Service:** Brokers can start a trade which will give them the agreed portion of the trade. In this process identity of seller and buyer remain anonymous to one another and only broker knows them.

- **Wallet Security:** Crypto wallets are generated and stored in a MySQL database in an encrypted state. No external services are used to manage the wallets.

- **Supported Networks:**
   - Solana
   - Litecoin
   - Dogecoin
   - BSC (BEP-20)

- **Planned Networks:**

   - Tron (TRC-20)
   - TON

- **Excluded Networks:**

   - Bitcoin (due to high fees and slow transaction times)

Iâ€™m open to discussions on which networks to add and how to make this bot better and easier to use.
